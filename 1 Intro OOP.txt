Chapter 1: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming:

**Flashcard 1: Programming Paradigms**
- Programming Paradigms: Classify programming languages based on their features.
- Imperative Programming: Specifies how to do something, e.g., C, C++.
- Declarative Programming: Declares what needs to happen, e.g., SQL, HTML.

**Flashcard 2: Procedural Programming**
- In procedural programming, problems are decomposed into repeatable procedures.
- Focus on processes, no information hiding, difficult for large programs.

**Flashcard 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- OOP combines data (attributes) and functions (behavior) into objects.
- Objects are instances of classes, which are templates for objects.
- OOP focuses on objects, not just operations.

**Flashcard 4: What Becomes Objects in OOP?**

- Objects can represent human entities, physical objects, computer-user environment elements, data storage constructs, and more.



**Flashcard 5: Principles of OOP**

- Encapsulation: Bundling data with methods and hiding data.
- Abstraction: Providing essential information, hiding implementation.
- Inheritance: Deriving properties from another class.
- Polymorphism: Processing objects differently based on their data type.



**Flashcard 6: Benefits of OOP**

- Reusability: Classes can be used in different programs.
- Robustness: Supports exception and error handling.
- Extensibility: Add features to existing classes through inheritance.
- Easier to manage: Objects are self-contained and reduce program complexity.
